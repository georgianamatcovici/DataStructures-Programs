This repository contains some of the programs I wrote in the first semester of the faculty for the Data Structures discipline. To get a better understanding of some important data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, and their specific operations and sorting algorithms,  I implemented the concepts described during the courses using C++ language. The C++ programs also contain useful functions and some examples of function calls.
